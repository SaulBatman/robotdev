# Spot Navigation

Spot SDK provides [the GraphNav service](https://dev.bostondynamics.com/docs/concepts/autonomy/graphnav_service).

You can record a map "using the GraphNavRecording service".


Spot SDK's GraphNav is intended for autonomous site inspection;
basically, the robot would autonomously navigate from waypoint
to waypoint, designed for the specific site.
