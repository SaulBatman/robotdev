# Manipulation and Control

I have developed a package for doing "hard-coded" manipulation
and control with MOVO. Refer to the [documentation for it here](./src/rbd_movo_action/rbd_movo_motor_skills/README.md).
It is not perfect but currently it offers one possible solution.


## MOVO joint state topics


## MOVO control topics

Look at [this Github thread](https://github.com/Kinovarobotics/kinova-movo/issues/33).
