## Creating this package

```
catkin_create_pkg movo_motor_skills ar_track_alvar std_msgs rospy roscpp pcl_ros pcl_msgs moveitg
catkin_make -DCATKIN_WHITELIST_PACKAGES="movo_motor_skills"
```

## Using the moveit_client and moveit_planner

Run the planner
```
./moveit_planner.py [group_names ...] -e [ee_frames ...]
```
A `group_name` is a name of a planning group in Moveit. You can see the list
of planning groups in RVIZ (via MotionPlanning->Planning Request->Planning Group dropdown).
Some groups of interest include: left_arm, left_gripper, right_arm, right_gripper, torso, head.

Each planning group has a corresponding end-effector frame, that is, the frame which you
can specify a world-space coordinate and the IK solver will find the joint space coordinates
for the arm's joints. For example, 'left_arm' planning group has an end-effector frame 'left_ee_link'
You can view all the frames by running `rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree`.

A valid command to run is:
```
./moveit_planner.py left_arm -e left_ee_link
```
You should see a bunch of messages with no error,
followed by some (likely blue) highlighted texts "Starting moveit_planner_server"...


Now, you can run the client to send motion planning requests.
