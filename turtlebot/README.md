This is the ROS workspace for turtlebot. It is
created as I go through the Turtlebot tutorial:
https://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/platform/turtlebot3/simulation/

Note that there are many outdated tutorials (dating back to 2015).
The above is referenced by [this blog](https://automaticaddison.com/how-to-launch-the-turtlebot3-simulation-with-ros/)
written in 2020.

See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) for overcoming
issues encountered while setting up this workspace.
